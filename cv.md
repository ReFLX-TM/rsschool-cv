## Summary:

My objective is to be one of the best Developers, first in *JavaScript* as a Full Stack Developer. Later my goal is develop my own videogame, maybe in JS or another language. 
    
I wish to travel many countries, in special, Japan, by using my programming skills and learning new languages.
    
I am __very perfectionist__ and I love solving problems with simple code, that's why I am constantly learning about programming, improving my knowledge every day with new coding techniques.

## Skills: 

I have knowledge with Html, CSS and JavaScript, a litte bit of the ReactJS Framework and i have experience with Git and GitHub.

## Code examples:

1. Is a number prime?
```javascript
function isPrime(num) {
 if (num > 1){
    for (let i = 2; i <= Math.sqrt(num); i++){
      if (num % i == 0){
        return false;
      }
    }
    return num !== 1;
  }else 
    return false;
}
```
2. Count characters in a string
```javascript
function count (string) {  
  var res = {};
  string.split("").map((a, b, c) => res[c[b]] = c.join("").match(RegExp(c[b],'g')).length)
  return res
}
```
3. Find the shortest word 
```javascript
function findShort(s){
  const arr = s.split(" ");
  let short = 100;
    for (let i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
      short > arr[i].length ? short = arr[i].length : null;
    }
  return short
}
```
